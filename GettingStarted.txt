These examples assume that you have installed a minimum of Java SE 8 and Apache ant.
There are existing .bat files for Windows platforms. The scripts are typically only one or two lines, so for other platforms just invoke the commands directly.

Java SE 8 is available for download at http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp.
Apache ant 1.10.1 is available for download at http://ant.apache.org. 
Java EE 8 - GlassFish 5 is available for download at https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/download

1. Download and and unzip the example zip file to a directory. We refer to that directory as <EXAMPLES_HOME>.

2. Edit <EXAMPLES_HOME>/config/setenv.bat to point to your JDK 1.8 and ant 1.8.0 installation 
   directories if JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME have not been set in your environment.

3. Download and install Glassfish V5 from http://download.oracle.com/glassfish/5.0/release/glassfish-5.0-web.zip.
   We recommend installing the Glassfish V5 Web Profile.

4. Edit <EXAMPLES_HOME>/config/common.properties and set the following properties:

       EXAMPLES_HOME - the folder in which the examples were unzipped 
       SERVER_HOME - the folder in which Glassfish was installed
  
   NOTE: Make sure you use a forward slash separator ('/') not a backward slash ('\')

5. Start Glassfish and the Derby database by invoking the startservers.bat script
   in <EXAMPLES_HOME>/bin.

6. Open <EXAMPLES_HOME>/examples/examplesHome.html to get started.

   For each server-based example:

        1. Run deploy.bat before running the example
        2. Run undeploy.bat when finished with the example

   The client-based examples have a run.bat script. They assume the database is 
   already runnning, as in step 5.
